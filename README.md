# Tenma #

**Tenma is currently in alpha. I can not claim that this application is secure to run over the internet.**

Tenma is a comic server built on Django that allows you to store, organize, and read comics. It focuses heavily on creating relationships between issues spanning different series based on Characters, Creators, Teams, Story Arcs and Publishers. To do this, it leverages the [ComicVine](http://comicvine.gamespot.com) [API](http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api) to retrieve metadata on your comics (ComicVine account required for this optional feature). 

## Features ##

* Read your comics from any device that has a browser.
* Two view modes. Fit the comic horizontally or vertically to your browser window.
* Comic navigation with arrow buttons, or with your keyboard's arrow keys.
* Supports CBZ, ZIP, CBR, RAR, CBT and TAR formats.

## Installation and Configuration ##

Please refer to the Wiki for installation and configuration instructions for different operating systems.
